# Environmental-Sound-Classification-with-Deep-Learning
This repository implements deep learning models (CNNs, RNNs, and CRNNs) for classifying environmental sounds using spectral features like MFCCs and Mel spectrograms. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, optimized for datasets like UrbanSound8K.
